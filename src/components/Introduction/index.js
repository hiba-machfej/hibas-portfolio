            I am experienced in advancing technical projects and empowering students to join the tech community. Through my work as a coding trainer, I've developed a skill for making complex concepts accessible. My academic studies in Architecture and Urban Design enriched my skills in crafting intuitive, user-centered UI/UX designs. I do my best to merge technical know-how, design insight, and educational experience to make meaningful contributions to development and design initiatives.
            <br /> <br /> Well, I am always up for a challenge and I love learning new things. That's exactly why I chose to learn coding. I believe creativity is born from hybrid skills. So, I am quite excited to translate my past experiences into digital products. aren't you?
